# Palette's Journal - Critical Learnings

## 2024-05-27 - Accessible Grouped Inputs
**Learning:** When multiple inputs share a single conceptual visual label (e.g., minimum and maximum bounds for a single parameter), using a standard `<label>` tag creates ambiguous or broken associations for screen readers. They don't map cleanly to multiple inputs.
**Action:** Always wrap grouped inputs in a `<fieldset>` with a `<legend>` replacing the generic visual label, and provide specific `aria-label` attributes to the individual inner inputs to describe their specific roles within the group.

## 2024-05-28 - Heavy Computation Feedback
**Learning:** For heavy, blocking numerical solvers on the backend, lack of visual feedback and disabled states leads to user confusion and duplicate requests. Screen readers also need explicit context during these async operations.
**Action:** Always set action buttons to `disabled=true`, switch text to a loading state, and set `aria-busy="true"` immediately upon starting the fetch, resetting in the `finally` block. Combine with CSS pseudo-class `:disabled` for visual cues like reduced opacity and `not-allowed` cursor.
